    /*ARRAY METHODS:

      toString() 
          converts an array to a string separating item by a comma ,

      join()
          join elements into a string, you can define the separator array.join(' - ')

      pop()
          removes the last element of the array. You can save that element in a variable
          let x = array.pop()  -->> x = last element of the array, but the array won't have that element anymore

      push()
          adds an element at the end of the array. Can add multiple elements

      shift()
          removes the first element of the array; you can also save that element in a variable
          let y = array.shift()  -->> y = first element, but the array won't have it anymore

      unshift()
          adds a new element at the beginnings. Can add multiple elements

      delete
          you can delete elements by its index using: delete array[index]
          delete will leave an empty index which is 'undefined', try to use pop() or shift() instead
      
      splice()
          adds new items at x index.
          fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
          fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi")

          fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Kiwi", "Apple", "Mango"]

          splice(position, parametersToRemove, items, to, add)

          splice() can be used to delete items without leaving holes like 'delete'
          fruits.splice(0, 1) -->> at index zero, delete 1 item, which removes the first element like shift()

      concat()
          creates a new array by merging existing arrays
          var myGirls = ["Cecilie", "Lone"];
          var myBoys = ["Emil", "Tobias"];
          var myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys); -->> ["Cecilie", "Lone", "Emil", "Tobias"]

          you can concatenate multiple arrays
          let finalArray = arr1.concat(arr2, arr3, arr4);

          you can even add strings array.concat("Peter"); this will act like push()

      slice()
          slice out a piece of an array into a new array
          fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];
          citrus = fruits.slice(1) -->> slices from "Orange" to "Mango"

          structure:
          slice(index)  -->> starts at index to the end of the array
          slice(indexX, indexY)  -->> starts at indexX to indexY
          slice(0 , indexY)  -->> starts from zero to indexY
