      name: "John",

    };

    //=============Delete key:values properties=================

    delete user.life

    //============You can add properties and multiword properties============

      name: "Sofia",

    let fruits_bag = {};

    fruits_bag[fruit] = 10;

    alert(`My fruit bag has ${fruits_bag[fruit]} ${fruit}s`);

    //and you can rewrite it like this:

    let fruit2 = prompt("Which fruit do you like the most?", "apple"); //enter pineapple

    let fruits_bag2 = {
      [fruit2]: 5,
    };

    alert(fruits_bag2.pineapple); //it can use the value entered as the key

    //more complex compound properties

    let brand = "apple";

    let shoppingKart = {
      [brand + "Computers"]:10,
    };

    alert(shoppingKart.appleComputers); //See that apple is now join to Computer = appleComputers

    /*=============================
    
    Test a property with "in"

    =================================
    If you want to test a property, just put it like this:
     
    "key" in object --->>> this will return true or false if that key exists.

    If a key doesn't exist, its value is "undefined"
